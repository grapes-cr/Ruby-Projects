# README

This is mainly a test with RoR. Running the server will open a Shop scaffold where you can input a Shop name, Amount of Shelves, and Candies.

Candies and Shelves do not create Shelf or Candy objects, only a string and integer respectively.

Assuming you have Rails and SQLite3 installed and a Linux environment, you can run:

`$ cd Rails`

`$ rails server`

and run localhost:3000 in your browser. You will be able to create a shop, edit it, and delete it.
